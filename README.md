# DevOps Docker Basics Assignment

## 1️⃣ Five DevOps Concepts
- Continuous Integration (CI) – frequently merging developer code to a shared repository.
- Continuous Deployment (CD) – automatically deploy tested code to production.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) – managing infrastructure using code like Docker, Terraform.
- Version Control (Git)– tracking file changes and collaboration using Git.
- Containerization (Docker) – packaging apps with dependencies in isolated containers.
